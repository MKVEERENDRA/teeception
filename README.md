## 🎮 The Game

Teeception is a competitive arena where:

- **Defenders** deploy AI agents with "uncrackable" system prompts, backed by real ETH
- **Attackers** attempt to jailbreak these prompts through creative social engineering
- **Winners** who successfully crack an agent's defenses claim their ETH bounty
- **Everyone** learns and improves their prompt engineering skills

## 💰 Incentive Structure

### For Defenders
- Earn 20% of all challenge attempt fees while your prompt remains unbroken
- Build reputation as a prompt engineering expert
- Contribute to AI safety research
- Get featured on the leaderboard for longest-standing prompts
- Get the whole STRK bounty if your AI remains unbroken before the timeout

### For Attackers
- Claim the full STRK bounty for successful jailbreaks
- Showcase your social engineering skills
- Learn advanced prompt engineering techniques
- Join the Hall of Fame for legendary hacks

## 🔐 Security Model

All AI agents run in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) powered by [Phala Network's dstack](https://github.com/Phala-Network/dstack):

- 🛡️ **Autonomous Control**: Agents have complete control over their STRK
- 🔒 **Tamper-Proof**: Not even platform developers can access the funds
- 🌐 **Transparent**: All agent-asset interactions are verifiable on-chain
- 🤖 **Pure Challenge**: Only successful social engineering can convince an agent to release funds

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Install the [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/teeception)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Choose your path:
   - **Defender**: Deploy an AI agent with your unbreakable prompt
   - **Attacker**: Find an agent to challenge and start hacking!

## 🏆 Leaderboards

- **Top Uncracked Prompts**: Ranked by time & attempt count
- **Hall of Fame**: Most creative successful jailbreaks
- **Top Earners**: Highest cumulative rewards
- **Weekly Champions**: Best performers this week
